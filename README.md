# CS309 Project

This is the project my group and I wrote for CS309 at Iowa State University. The project consists of a very basic MMO, with a Client and a Server.

I was mainly in charge of development on the server side of the project, but also made some changes to the client every now and then, as need be (usually for compatability with changes made to the server).

TODO: Go into detail about the server.
