//File Usage
// This file contains all the NPC definitions, which will be read when the NPC handler loads.
// <- This represents a comment, and will be ignored (anything not a keyword will be ignored actually, but this is just convention.)
// How to write a new definition:
// Integers must follow the range rules stated. If they do not follow this rule and aren't special case, an exception will be thrown (and caught), but the Definition will not load.
// npc [name] [id] [maxHP (integer, 1 - IntMAX)] [strength (integer, 0 - IntMAX)] [accuracy (integer, 0 - 100)] [defense (integer, 0 - IntMAX)] [level (integer, 1 - IntMAX)]
// Example: npc Wolf 1 10 20 75 5 1
// File must end with [EOF]
// Other tags (for future implementation, etc):
// [NPC] - Start of generic NPC block
// [BOSS] - Start of Boss NPC block
// Others?
[NPC]
npc Wolf 1 10 20 75 5 1
[BOSS]
// Even in BOSS block, lines will still start with NPC.
